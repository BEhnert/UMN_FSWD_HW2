Homework 2 - Bootstrap Portfolio Site
========================================

Objectives
-------------
  * Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.


Summary of modifications
---------------------------
    Created 3 pages and used Bootstrap to get a common grid layout to use on each page

    Pages need more work as I could not get some elements working as expected
    Did not have time to comment code and do a proper Readme
    Will be discussing more in detail with instructor/TAs/Tutor
